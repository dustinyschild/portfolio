Delta V 301 portfolio Chuck Forsythe

## Owner stories

- As a owner, I would like to have a website that shows off my talents as a web designer to prospective employers.

- This site will not only demonstrate my ability to build a functional site but also to showcases my portfolio of previous projects form the Delta V code school to show my how my skills have developed over time.

- This site will contain:
    - contact information
    - CV
    - website "library"
    - selection of previous art and design work

- This site should push my skills as a designer but not be too difficult to pull off.

- This site needs to be unique or memorable to someone who views many applicants.

## Owner/Developer stories

- Site must be rendered correctly by a variety of browsers, not just Chrome.

## Employer stories

- As a employer I would like to see a website that works well and contains few, if any, bugs.

- The site should be easy to navigate and self explanatory.

- I would like to be able to view this site on a variety of platforms.

- Examples of work should be visually striking and have well worded descriptions.

## MVP goals

- As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.

- As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.

- As a developer, I want wireframes for each of the main views in my portfolio, so I will have a concrete idea of the design I am building.

- As a developer, I want to make a data model (object constructor) for my portfolio data, so I can store individual projects and render them to the DOM.

- As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.

- As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.

- As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.
